# Twitch Streaming App

This is the Twitch Streaming App I developed for [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/). The latest commit now includes [client 
authentication](https://blog.twitch.tv/client-id-required-for-kraken-api-calls-afbb8e95f843#.5jhwtiipe) as required by Twitch, beginning August 8th, 2016.

The complete app is available to view on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/Nyxx/full/kXJAvv/).

Cool features of the app - 

* Lists three types of channels - online, offline, closed
* Buttons to filter among the three channels
* Client Authentication, now mandated by Twitch
* And some fun effects!
